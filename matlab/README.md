# MATLAB
This directory contains a couple of MATLAB scripts used to compute the unknown camera-to-hand transformation, as well as testing and visualizing the result. The calibration_pointpicking script is compiled into a stand-alone application using MCC and is then used in the camera_hand_calibration program.
